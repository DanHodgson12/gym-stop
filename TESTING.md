# Testing

## Testing Paradigms

There are two types of testing a developer can carry out before, during and after writing a web application - Automated and Manual.

### Automated Testing

1. __Quicker__: Automated testing allows for hundreds of tests to be run in a short space of time, making it more resourceful than Manual testing.
2. __Efficient__: Tests written by developers help to detect errors earlier on, and help avoid writing code that likely won't perform as expected.
3. __Specific__: Tests can be written for specific edge cases in which manual testing may not be able to pick up.
4. __Resourceful__: Automated tests can be used for continuous testing of an application, making it easier to find an error if a new piece of content is added to a page, for example.
5. __Data-driven__: Automated testing can be used to check if a piece of code provides the same outcome when using different sources of data.

### Manual Testing

1. __UX(User Experience)__: Manual testing allows for the developer to check if the user experience of the application is as intended.
2. __Layout/Responsiveness__: Manual testing allows for the developer to inspect the application on different browsers and devices, which is something automated testing would not pick up on.
3. __Animation & Interactivity__: Manual testing allows for the developer to check if animations and interactions between elements are performing as expected.
4. __Accessibility__: Manual testing allows the developer to test the application with screen readers and make sure it is accessible.

Although one form of testing may be more appropriate than the other for a specific application, they do both have downsides. The disadvantage of one form of testing is usually something the other form of testing can provide.

Due to this, it is best practice to utilise both forms of testing during the building of an application. However, the choice for which form of testing to use depends on resources available, budget and whether or not you have a team large enough to carry out the tests.

The developer chose to use automated testing as the main form of testing throughout this project. They felt it was an efficient method for this type of application due to its size and the fact that a lot of aspects of the application relied on functions rendering and manipulating data.

## Code Testing

Automated code testing was carried out within the development environment. Each Python file was tested inside its own test file - each test file was name after the file being tested, prepended with 'test_' (for example, views.py's test file is named test_views.py). If you navigate to the test files for each app in the GitHub repository, you will see a detailed view of all tests carried out.

[Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.5.3/) was used to check how much of the Python code had been tested. You can see in the image below that 98% of the code has been covered with testing.

![Coverage Report](assets/coverage-report.png)

The 'settings.py' and 'manage.py' files were ignored, as they had been set up automatically as part of the project creation aspect of Django, with minor adjustments made to variables within.

Due to time constraints, a high amount of manual testing being carried out on the subscribe, checkout and profiles app, and no functionality issues noticed in the manual testing of the website in general, the developer chose to ignore the lines not being tested in these files.

## Known Bugs

There are no known bugs with the web application.

## Code Validation

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) services were used to check for any code errors or misuse of syntax/elements in the HTML & CSS.

The [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) service was used to check for any code errors or misuse of syntax in the JavaScript.

The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) services were used to check for any linting errors in the Python code.

### HTML

The W3C Markup Validator returned multiple errors and warnings with a lot of the Django templating language used. The developer chose to ignore these specific warnings, as this tool is primarily designed to validate static HTML and doesn't recognize server-side templating languages, including Django.

Other than the above, there were no legitimate errors in the HTML code.

### CSS

The W3C CSS Validator returned no errors in the code.
![CSS Validation](static/images/css-validation.png)

### JavaScript

The JSHint Validation returned a one error in the JS files for undefined variables:

- `$` - This was ignored as it is required for functions using jQuery.

### Python

Flake8 returned 11 errors in the code. However, these errors were mainly for "line too long" in the 'migrations' files. These were left untouched as they were autmoatically generated files.

There were also other files such as env.py, settings.py and apps.py (for each project) that teh developer chose to ignore.

There was also one error type that was chosen to be ignored - *W503 line break before binary operator*. Upon fixing this error, another error occurs - *W504 line break after binary operator*. As these errors conflict with one another, the decision was made to chose to ignore one of the errors - W503.
